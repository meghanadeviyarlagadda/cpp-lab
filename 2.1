Multilevel Inheritance: A class is derived from a class which is also derived from another class.
Syntax:
class Base { // members };
class Intermediate : public Base { // inherits Base };
class Derived : public Intermediate { // inherits Intermediate (and indirectly Base) };
Program: 
#include<iostream> 
using namespace std; 
class vehicle{ public:
vehicle(){
cout<<"This is a vehicle"<<endl;}
};
class fourwheeler:public vehicle{ public:
fourwheeler
cout<<"4 wheeler vehicles"<<endl;
}
};
class car:public fourwheeler{ public:
car(){
cout<<"This 4 wheeler vehicle is a car";
}
};
int main(){
cout<<"Roll No:24B11AI254"<<endl;
car obj; return 0;
}
Hierarchical Inheritance: Multiple classes inherit from a single base class.
Syntax:
class Base { // members };
class Derived1 : public Base { // inherits Base }; class Derived2 : public Base { // inherits Base }; 
Program:
#include<iostream>
using namespace std; class vehicle{
public:
vehicle
cout<<"This is a vehicle"<< endl;
}
};
class car : public vehicle{ public:
car(){
cout<<"This vehicle is a car"<< endl;
}
};
class bus : public vehicle{ public:
bus(){
cout<<"This vehicle is bus"<< endl;
}
};
int main(){
cout<<"Roll No:24B11AI254"<<endl;
car obj1; bus obj2;
}
Hybrid Inheritance :
#include<iostream>
using namespace std; 
class vehicle{ public:
vehicle(){
cout<<"this is a vehicle"<<endl;
}
};
class fare{ public: fare(){
cout<<"fare of a vehicle"<<endl;
}
};
class car:public vehicle{ public:
car(){
cout<<"this vehicle is a car"<<endl;
}
};
class bus:public vehicle,public fare{ public:
bus(){
cout<<"this vehicle is a bus with fare"<<endl;
}
};
int main()
{
cout<<"Roll No:24B11AI254"<<endl;
bus obj2;
}
